This is a software engineering team generator command line application. Users are asked to fill out their employees' information based on the criteria: Name, role, ID, email, office number/github/school. The information is then stored in the newly created rendered HTML file, team.html, where the employee information is inputted into a pre-designed card with corresponding icons based on the employees' role at the company.

This is a software engineering team generator command line application. Users will need to install Inquirer first via "npm install inquirer." Then, users are asked to fill out their employees' information based on the criteria: Name, role, ID, email, office number/github/school. The information is then stored in the newly created rendered HTML file, team.html, where the employee information is inputted into a pre-designed card with corresponding icons based on the employees' role at the company.
